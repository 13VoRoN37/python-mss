An ultra fast cross-platform multiple screenshots module in pure python using ctypes
====================================================================================

Very basic, it will grab one screen shot by monitor or a screen shot of all monitors and save it to a PNG file, Python 2.6/3.5 compatible & PEP8 compliant.
It could be easily embedded into games and other softwares which require fast and plateforme optimized methods to grab screenshots.

**MSS** stands for Multiple ScreenShots.

It's under MIT license and there is a `beautiful documentation <http://python-mss.readthedocs.io/>`_ :).
