Welcome to Python MSS's documentation!
======================================

An ultra fast cross-platform multiple screenshots module in pure python using ctypes.

    - **Python 2.6/3.6** and :pep:`8` compliant, no dependency;
    - very basic, it will grab one screen shot by monitor or a screen shot of all monitors and save it to a PNG file;
    - but you can use PIL and benefit from all its formats (or add yours directly);
    - it could be easily embedded into games and other softwares which require fast and plateforme optimized methods to grab screenshots;
    - get the `source code on GitHub <https://github.com/BoboTiG/python-mss>`_;
    - and `report a bug <https://github.com/BoboTiG/python-mss/issues>`_;
    - **MSS** stands for Multiple ScreenShots;
    - insanely fast, did I said it?
