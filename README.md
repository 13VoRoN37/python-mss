An ultra fast cross-platform multiple screenshots module in pure python using ctypes
====================================================================================

Very basic, it will grab one screen shot by monitor or a screen shot of all monitors and save it to a PNG file, Python 2.6/3.5 compatible & PEP8 compliant.
It could be easily embedded into games and other softwares which require fast and plateforme optimized methods to grab screenshots.

**MSS** stands for **M**ultiple **S**creen**S**hots.

It's under zlib licence.


Installation
------------

```shell You can install it with pip
pip install --upgrade mss
```


Support

Feel free to try MSS on a system we had not tested, and let report us by creating an [issue](https://github.com/BoboTiG/python-mss/issues).


Testing
-------

You can try the MSS module directly from the console:

```shell
python tests.py
```


Instance the good class
-----------------------

So MSS can be used as simply as:

```python
from mss import mss
with mss() as screenshotter:
    # ...
```

Or import the good one (choose one):

```python
# MacOS X
from mss.darwin import MSS

# GNU/Linux
from mss.linux import MSS

# Microsoft Windows
from mss.windows import MSS


with MSS() as screenshotter:
    # ...
```

Of course, you can use it the old way:

```python
from mss import mss  # or from mss.linux import MSS as mss
screenshotter = mss()
# ...
```


Errors
------

If an error occures, the `ScreenshotError` exception is raised.


Examples
--------

One screenshot per monitor:

```python
for filename in screenshotter.save():
    print(filename)
```

Screenshot of the monitor 1:

```python
print(next(screenshotter.save(mon=1)))
```

Screenshot of the monitor 1, with callback:

```python
def on_exists(fname):
    ''' Callback example when we try to overwrite an existing
        screenshot.
    '''

    from os import rename
    from os.path import isfile

    if isfile(fname):
        newfile = fname + '.old'
        print('{0} -> {1}'.format(fname, newfile))
        rename(fname, newfile)
    return True

print(next(screenshotter.save(mon=1, callback=on_exists)))
```

A screenshot to grab them all:

```python
print(next(screenshotter.save(mon=-1, output='fullscreen.png')))
```

API: version 2
==============

enum_display_monitors(force)
----------------------------

Get positions and dimensions of monitors.

Parameter:

    force (boolean, default: False)
        If set to True, if will rescan for monitors informations.

It stocks monitors informations into `monitors` and returns it.


get_pixels(monitor)
-------------------

Retrieve screen pixels for a given monitor.

Parameter:

    monitor (dict)
        A dict generated by enum_display_monitors().

It stocks pixels data into `image` (RGB) and returns it.


save(mon, output, callback)
---------------------------

Grab a screenshot and save it to a file.

Parameters:

    mon (integer, default: 0)
        -1: grab one screenshot of all monitors
         0: grab one screenshot by monitor
         N: grab the screenshot of the monitor N

    output (string, default: monitor-%d.png)
        The output filename.
        %d, if presents, will be replaced by the monitor number.

    callback (method)
        Callback called before saving the screenshot to a file.
        Take the 'output' argument as parameter.

This is a generator which returns created files.


to_png(data, width, height, output)
-----------------------------------

Dump data to the image file.

Parameters:

    data (bytes)
        Raw data (pixels) into RGB mode.

    width and height (integer)
        Dimensions of the output image.

    output (string)
        The output filename.
